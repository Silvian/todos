Novastone To-Do list project

he application provides APIs only. There is no web UI or client application for this service, only a stand-alone service with RESTful APIs.
 
The application must be able to
-  Use username and password (or equivalent) to log in users
-  Use cookies (or effective alternative) to authenticate all API requests
-  Create a new to do item (containing a text description)
-  List a userâ€™s set of to do items
-  Mark any single to do item as completed
-  Delete any single to do item
-  Log a user out
-  Run using Python 3.6 or higher
-  Use JSON for data exchange
 
Considerations:
-  Creation of new users is out of scope.  The set of users can be hardcoded (at least one user)
-  The APIs should be RESTful
-  A quick, sure and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as intended, should be delivered alongside the service
-  Any libraries and frameworks can be used as long as they are publically available or included with the code.
